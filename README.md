Mac OS X Vagrant box for VirtualBox
=========================
This is a issue tracker for OS X Vagrant boxes, which can be found in Download section

Box was tested only on VirtualBox with Mac OS as a host. Mainly, I made it to build our iOS applications via CI-server.

Downloads
--
You can find following images on [VagrantCloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/AndrewDryga/boxes/vagrant-box-osx):

* Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 (XCode 6.4) (13Gb) (sha1: e02ea7fff9c3af980bfa733c8feb2e03bf562cfd)
* macOS Sierra (XCode 8.2) (14.1Gb)

Notice it can take a while to download the image as they are large and can be throtled by VagrantCloud hosting.

Setting up
--
1. Install [Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads);
2. ```cd``` into your project directory;
3. Run ```vagrant init AndrewDryga/vagrant-box-osx```;
4. Your Vagrantfile should be ready as soon as Vagrant downloads box;
5. Start VM by calling ```vagrant up```.

OS X Licensing
--
Apple's EULA states that you can install your copy on your actual Apple-hardware, plus up to two VMs running on your Apple-hardware. So using this box on another hardware is may be illegal and you should do it on your own risk.

By using it you agree with all macOS Sierra and XCode license agreements.

Common issues
--
* Box may [crash on AMD-based hosts](https://github.com/AndrewDryga/vagrant-box-osx/issues/52) due to VirtualBox issues.
* Do not turn 3D acceleration on in VirtualBox, or it will start retuning aborted condition and would not start in headless mode;
* VirtualBox doesn't have Guest additions for Mac OS X, so you can't have shared folders. Instead you can use normal network shared folders ([docs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/nfs.html)):
```
    # Use NFS for the shared folder
    config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant",
        id: "core",
        :nfs => true,
        :mount_options => ['nolock,vers=3,udp,noatime']
```
* If your VM freezes with ```hfs mounted macintosh hd on device root_device``` then you need to set cpuidset inside your Vagrantfile: ```vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpuidset", "1","000206a7","02100800","1fbae3bf","bfebfbff"]``` (it's included since version 0.2);
* If your mouse does not work on a MacBook Pro host machine, shut down the VM and open the VirtualBox Manager. Edit the VM's settings. Choose the _System_ tab. Under the _Motherboard_ sub-tab, set the _Chipset_ option to be _PIIX 3_, and set the _Pointing Device_ option to be _USB Tablet_. Restart the VM;
* When OSX is trying to prompt graphically for password (i.e when using swift REPL), it will raise the error ```error:process exited with status -1) (lost connection)``` because there is no graphical output when using vagrant via ssh login, enable the develop mode can solve this situation, run the following command:
```sudo /usr/sbin/DevToolsSecurity --enable```;
* If you need user password (for example for Homebrew Cask). Vagrant have default consideration to create user ```vagrant``` with password ```vagrant```, you can use it.

Warning
--
VirtualBox support for Mac OS X is experimental. More information can be found in [official docs](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#intro-macosxguests).

Tips to build your own box
--
Main think you should remember is that you need latest VirtualBox version BEFORE you start installation. Process of installation is pretty straight forward (as on usual Mac), but you need to erase virtual drive during installation via Disk Utilities. After that just follow [Vagrant guide](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/base.html) to create base box and [another one](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/virtualbox/boxes.html) to package it.

Sometimes you need to [rebuild VirtualBox kernel extensions](https://gist.github.com/AndrewDryga/9880938) before installing OS on VM.
